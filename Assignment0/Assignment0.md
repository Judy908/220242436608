Question 2:
 What are differences between data wrangling, scanning, and filtering in data mining?

Data wrangling:
> Refer to the end-to-end process of cleaning data, merging data, transforming data and enhancing raw data in the way can be used in analysis and machine learning. 
> This ensures data is reliable and consistent for specific use.

WHILE
Data scanning:
> Refer to the initial step of reviewing and examining the data to know it’s format, quality and challenges that encounter with.
> This helps to appreciate the  quality of dataset's and decides the steps to be followed in data cleaning and transformations.

WHILE
Data filtering:
> Refer to a specific technique of selecting a small part and important data based on specific criteria and  rules. 
> It separates  certain data points by removing the usefulness data by focusing on specific group.
