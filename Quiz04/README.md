TO GENERATE A FREQUENCY ITEM GIVEN min_support=40%
step1: to calculate the mean support count
   given; total number of transactions, n=7
          min_support= 40% 0r 0.4
    then, 
         min_support_count=n*min_support_thredhold
                          = 7*0.4
                          =2.8
          mean support count is approximated to 3.
